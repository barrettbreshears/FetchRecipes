# Fetch Recipes
## Simple demo for a recipes take home test app

The app was built quickly to meet the following criteria:

- The user should be shown a list of meals in the Dessert category, sorted alphabetically.
- When the user selects a meal, they should be taken to a detail view that includes:
• Meal name
• Instructions
• Ingredients/measurements

## There are no dependencies or special instructions to run this project. Just downlaod sourcecode and open in xcode and hit run.
